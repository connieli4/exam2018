# I think the coolest thing that I learned about python was the turtle drawing function. I remember following along in class creating squares and circles and thinking it was pretty straightforward. Once I went back to my room and tried the exercises (flower and yinyang) I spent 4 hours just trying to figure it out. I took webtech last year and I it was my favorite class at Babson. I could sit there and design my website for 8 hours at a time and I would forget to eat/drink water and it felt like maybe an three hours max. I had the same feeling over the summer during my internship, where I helped code an application for the Sales Team to use. I had the same feeling again trying to draw the Yin Yang. I remember hearing all of my friends in the common room having fun on a Thursday night and I was locked in my room coding away. Finally figuring out how to get the yin yang to draw out was one of the best feelings of accomplishment. I also was just so surprised that Python could actually draw a shape based on a few lines of code. I always thought code could only do what we learned in webtech, change text/colors/formatting. Even the application I worked on over the summer was taking data from a huge data base and presenting it on a webpage, so it still was only changing text. I never knew you could create images or drawings. It helped me understand more of how phone applications games are created. My favorite part was discovering the pen.up and pen.down method. Overall, even though python has caused me a good deal of frustration, I do enjoy how challenging it is and how much brain power and creativity it takes to code.
